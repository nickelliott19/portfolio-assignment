                    <p> In this animated explainer video, I unpack how we technically see into the past every day when
                        we look up at the sky. This is because light takes time to reach our eyes and while that idea
                        might seem irrelevant on Earth, on the scale of space—it’s huge. This video was heavily inspired
                        by Lemmino’s style of animation in trying to make the viewer feel like they’re in space. I
                        incorporated expressions like the wiggle and float effect in order to give a more tangible feel
                        to the icons. I also added several effects like CC Radial Fast Blur to the planets to evoke the
                        idea of light and use it to better portray my explanation. I also did some original drawing in
                        adobe illustrator notably the coliseum and money sign in order to have more control over what
                        they looked like, but then I added texture to make them more lived in. I also wanted the
                        background of the star to be involved in the movement so I added displacement maps in order to
                        make it feel like the viewer was moving with the stars as we traveled through the content. I
                        decided not to add a lot of texture to the stars themselves because I didn’t want the viewer to
                        be distracted and instead focus on the distance light took to reach the eyes. I wanted this
                        video to be quick and simple. By mentioning popular stars and not including much about astronomy
                        or astrophysics, the viewer doesn’t need any background knowledge in order to understand the
                        video. I wanted the overall feel to be simplistic but nice to look at so I went for a more
                        minimalist style in order for the viewer to just focus on the visuals and the voiceover. All in
                        all, this video is meant to be an accessible and visually pleasing explainer to a common
                        experience everyone can do. </p>
